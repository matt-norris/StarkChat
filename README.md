Stark Chat: An Interactive GPT ChatBot that acts and sounds like Tony Stark

This project is a voice-activated AI Chatbot that replicates Tony Stark from the Avengers movies. The application integrates several state-of-the-art technologies to create a natural, intuitive user interface, providing a highly engaging user experience.

Key Technologies

Whisper: Developed by OpenAI, Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes spoken language into text. This enables users to interact with the chatbot through either typing or speaking, enhancing both accessibility and usability.
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): GPT is a powerful language understanding AI model developed by OpenAI. The model understands context, generates human-like text, and provides insightful answers to user queries.
Eleven Labs' Text-to-Speech service: GPT generated responses are converted into lifelike speech using Eleven Labs' Text-to-Speech service. This gives an auditory response to the user's query, simulating a natural conversation.
Python/Flask: The backend of the application is built using Python and Flask, a lightweight web server framework that handles HTTP requests and responses. Flask endpoints facilitate the interaction between the user interface and the underlying ASR, AI, and Text-to-Speech services.
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: The frontend is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The UI is sleek and modern, with text input, audio recording, and audio playback functionality for seamless interaction with the Chatbot.
Getting Started

To use this chatbot, you'll need to sign up at Eleven Labs to obtain an API key. This key allows the chatbot to use Eleven Labs' Text-to-Speech service to generate lifelike speech.

About the Project
